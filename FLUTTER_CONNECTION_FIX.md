# Flutter Connection Fix Guide

## üö® Problem Identified

The Flutter app was trying to access `/charity-campaigns` endpoint but the Laravel backend only had `/api/v1/campaigns`. This caused a connection error:

```
CampaignService: Trying endpoint: /charity-campaigns
CampaignService: Failed to fetch from endpoint /charity-campaigns: DioException [connection error]
```

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Charity Campaigns Endpoint

**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/Public/CampaignController.php`
- Added `charityCampaigns()` method
- Returns paginated list of active campaigns
- Includes proper OpenAPI documentation

**Method**:
```php
public function charityCampaigns(Request $request): JsonResponse
{
    $perPage = $request->get('per_page', 10);
    
    $campaigns = Campaign::active()
        ->with(['category', 'donations' => function ($query) {
            $query->where('status', 'paid');
        }])
        ->orderBy('created_at', 'desc')
        ->paginate($perPage);

    return response()->json([
        'message' => 'Charity campaigns retrieved successfully',
        'data' => CampaignResource::collection($campaigns),
        'meta' => [
            'current_page' => $campaigns->currentPage(),
            'per_page' => $campaigns->perPage(),
            'total' => $campaigns->total(),
            'last_page' => $campaigns->lastPage(),
        ],
    ]);
}
```

### 2. Added Route

**File**: `routes/api.php`
- Added route: `Route::get('/charity-campaigns', [CampaignController::class, 'charityCampaigns']);`
- Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/charity-campaigns`

### 3. Enhanced CORS Configuration

**File**: `bootstrap/app.php`
- Added CORS middleware for API routes
- Added global CORS headers

**File**: `config/cors.php` (new)
- Created comprehensive CORS configuration
- Allows all origins (`*`)
- Allows all methods and headers
- Configured for API routes

## üß™ Testing Results

### Before Fix:
```bash
# Flutter app error
CampaignService: Failed to fetch from endpoint /charity-campaigns: DioException [connection error]
```

### After Fix:
```bash
# API endpoint working
GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/charity-campaigns
Response: 200 OK
{
  "message": "Charity campaigns retrieved successfully",
  "data": [...],
  "meta": {...}
}
```

## üìã API Endpoints Available

### ‚úÖ Campaigns
- `GET /api/v1/campaigns` - All campaigns
- `GET /api/v1/campaigns/urgent` - Urgent campaigns
- `GET /api/v1/campaigns/featured` - Featured campaigns
- `GET /api/v1/campaigns/{id}` - Specific campaign
- `GET /api/v1/charity-campaigns` - **NEW** Charity campaigns for Flutter

### ‚úÖ CORS Headers
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: *`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *`

## üîß Flutter App Requirements

### Base URL Configuration
Make sure your Flutter app is configured to use:
```dart
const String baseUrl = 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1';
// or for production: 'https://your-domain.com/api/v1'
```

### Campaign Service
Your Flutter CampaignService should now work with:
```dart
Future<List<Campaign>> getCharityCampaigns() async {
  final response = await dio.get('/charity-campaigns');
  // ... handle response
}
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Restart Flutter App**: Clear cache and restart
2. **Test Connection**: Verify Flutter can now fetch charity campaigns
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check for any remaining connection issues
4. **Production Deployment**: Update base URL for production environment

## üìù Notes

- **Server Status**: Laravel server must be running on port 8000
- **CORS**: Now properly configured for cross-origin requests
- **Pagination**: Charity campaigns endpoint supports pagination
- **Documentation**: Full OpenAPI documentation included

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed
**Date**: 24 August 2025
**Tested**: Charity campaigns endpoint working correctly
